class NFA(_FSA):
    """A nondeterministic finite automaton class. Takes three parameters: a transition function, a start state 
    and a set of accept states, in that order.

    The transition function should be specified as a dictionary with tuple keys. 
    These keys implicitly define the nfa's state-set and alphabet; the first elements of the tuples represent the
    nfa's states, and the second elements are the symbols in the alphabet.

    The nfa expects the symbols of the alphabet to be one character strings. States can be anything hashable. (Note that,
    for reasons of hashability, you'll need to use frozensets, rather than sets, if you want to have sets as states.)

    The domain of the transition function is the power-set of the nfa's state set --- i.e., the values of the transition function
    dictionary should be sets (or frozensets). The empty set is a valid value; in fact, you are required to specify that the successor set
    for a given state-symbol pair is the empty set, if it is.

    You can define epsilon-moves by using the empty string in place of an alphabet symbol in the transition function.
    Note that the empty string will not be inferred to be a member of the alphabet (and hence the checks below will work as
    you would expect).

    The class will raise a ValueError exception on instantiation if any of the following are true:
        1. the start state is not a member of the set of states inferred from the transition function;
        2. the set of accept states is not a subset of the set of states inferred from the transition function;
        3. a member of the alphabet inferred from the transition function is not a one-character string;
        4. a member of the transition function's range is not a set;
        5. the range of the transition function is not a subset of the power set of states inferred from the transition function;
        6. the transition function is missing cases -- i.e., it is not the case that every pair of a state and a symbol
        is in the domain of the transition function.
    The exception message will specify which of these six conditions things triggered the exception, and which states/symbols
    are the source of the problem."""

        """Takes a regular expression and an alphabet (i.e., a set of one-character strings) as input; returns an NFA that recognises
        the language defined by that regular expression and that alphabet.
        
        The alphabet parameter is optional; it's default value is string.printable -- i.e., the set of "printable" characters,
        which includes the standard ASCII letters and digits, and most common punctuation and white space.

        Actually, that's not quite right -- the default value is string.printable *minus* parentheses, the vertical bar, the star symbol,
        and the tilde, for reasons that I will explain presently.

        As of now, the syntax of the regular expressions that this method takes as input is very simple -- much simpler than the
        standard python regular expresssions. All characters are intepreted as literals for symbols in the alphabet except for '(', '')',
        '|', '*', '•', '€' and 'Ø'. The parentheses, vertical bar and star mean what you'd expect them to mean if you are familiar with 
        regular expressions as written in programming languages. '•' (option-8 on a mac keyboard) means concatenation. 
        You can leave concatentation implicit, as is usual; no need to write '•'' explicitly if you don't want to. But it gets used internally. 
        '€' (option-shift-2) is used to match the empty string (because it kind of looks like an epsilon); there's no other way to match, 
        for instance, {'', '0'} with the current syntax. (Quick challenge: it's not totally obvious how to match the empty string in normal python regex syntax either, 
        though it can be done; give it a go.) 'Ø' (option-shift-o) represents the empty set; you can match to the empty language with it.

        For reaons related to the above, the characters '(', ')', '|', '*', '•', '€' and 'Ø' cannot be symbols in the alphabet of the NFA.
        (My apologies to speakers of Scandinavian languages for the last one; I am very against English chauvinism, but your letter is so very
        close to the empty-set symbol. If, by some miracle, there is someone who cares about this, I will change the symbol for empty-set.)

        In the absence of parentheses, the order of operations is: `*`, then `•`, then `|`.

        I realise the simplicity of the allowed syntax is lame; some day it might be better.

        The method uses a version of Dijkstra's shunting yard algorithm to parse the regex and build the NFA.

        The method will raise a ValueError exception if any of the following conditions hold:
            1. the alphabet contains any of the verboten characters -- i.e.,`(`, `)`, `|`, `*`, `•`, `€` and `Ø`,
            2. the input regex string contains a character not in the alphabet, and not one of the above veboten characters,
            3. the input regex contain a binary operator followed by an operator, or
            4. the input regex does not have properly matching parentheses.

class DFA(_FSA):
"""A deterministic finite automaton class. Takes three parameters: a transition function, a start state and a set of accept states, in that order.

The transition function should be specified as a dictionary with tuple keys. These keys implicitly define the dfa's state-set and alphabet; the first elements of the tuples represent the fsa's states, and the second elements are the symbols in the alphabet.

The dfa expects the symbols of the alphabet to be one character strings. States can be anything hashable. (Note that, for reasons of hashability, you'll need to use frozensets, rather than sets, if you want to have sets as states.)

The class will raise a ValueError exception on instantiation if any of the following are true:
  * the start state is not a member of the set of states inferred from the transition function;
  * the set of accept states is not a subset of the set of states inferred from the transition function;
  * the range of the transition function is not a subset of the set of states inferred from the transition function;
  * a member of the alphabet inferred from the transition function is not a one-character string;
  * the transition function is missing a case -- i.e., it is not the case that every pair of a state and a symbol is in the domain of the transition function.
The exception message will specify which of these above conditions things triggered the exception, and which states/symbols are the source of the problem."""
