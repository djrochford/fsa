class FST(_Base):
    """
    A finite state transducer class. Takes two parameters: a transition
    function, and a start state, in that order.

    The transition function should be specified as a dictionary with tuple
    keys and values. These keys implicitly define the fst's state-set and input
    alphabet; the first elements of the tuples represent the fst's states, and
    the second elements are the symbols in the alphabet.

    Similarly, the values should be tuples with the first element a state, the
    second member a symbol in the output alphabet, and the output alphabet
    (though not the state set) is implicitly defined by these values.

    The fst expects the symbols of both alphabets to be one character strings.
    States can be anything hashable. (Note that, for reasons of hashability,
    you'll need to use frozensets, rather than sets, if you want to have sets
    as states.)

    The class will raise a ValueError exception on instantiation if any of the
    following are true:
        1. the start state is not a member of the set of states inferred from
        the transition function;
        2. a member of the input alphabet inferred from the transition function
        is not a one-character string;
        3. a member of the output alphabet inferred from the transition
        function is not a one-character string;
        4. the range of the transition function is not a subset of the
        state-set inferred from the transition function;
        5. the transition function is missing cases -- i.e., it is not the case
        that every pair of a state and a symbol in the input alphabet is in the
        domain of the transition function.
    The exception message will specify which of these five conditions things
    triggered the exception, and which states/symbols are the source of the
    problem.
