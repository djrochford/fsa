class NFA:
    """A nondeterministic finite automaton class. Takes three parameters: a transition function, a start state 
    and a set of accept states, in that order.

    The transition function should be specified as a dictionary with tuple keys. 
    These keys implicitly define the nfa's state-set and alphabet; the first elements of the tuples represent the
    nfa's states, and the second elements are the symbols in the alphabet.

    The nfa expects the symbols of the alphabet to be one character strings. States can be anything hashable. (Note that,
    for reasons of hashability, you'll need to use frozensets, rather than sets, if you want to have sets as states.)

    The domain of the transition function is the power-set of the nfa's state set --- i.e., the values of the transition function
    dictionary should be sets.

    You can define epsilon-moves by using the empty string in place of an alphabet symbol in the transition function.
    Note that the empty string will not be inferred to be a member of the alphabet (and hence the checks below will work as
    you would expect).

    The class will raise a ValueError exception on instantiation if any of the following are true:
        1. the start state is not a member of the set of states inferred from the transition function;
        2. the set of accept states is not a subset of the set of states inferred from the transition function;
        3. a member of the alphabet inferred from the transition function is not a one-character string;
        4. a member of the transition function's range is not a set;
        5. the range of the transition function is not a subset of the power set of states inferred from the transition function.
        6. The transition function is missing cases -- i.e., it is not the case that every pair of a state and a symbol
        is in the domain of the transition function.
    The exception message will specify which of these four conditions things triggered the exception, and which states/symbols
    are the source of the problem."""
